# US 42 - Evaluate a Property Purchase/Lease Order

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an Agent, I want to evaluate a property purchase/lease order.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Specification**:
  - The agent must select a property purchase/lease order from a list of orders assigned to them.
  - Only orders that have not yet been evaluated should appear in the list.
  - The evaluation process should include an assessment of the proposed value, payment terms, and other relevant details provided by the client.

- **Clarification**:
  - The system must ensure that the agent can only access orders that are assigned to them.
  - Once evaluated, the order status must be updated to reflect its new state (e.g., "Approved" or "Rejected").

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC42-1**: The agent should choose the property purchase/lease order from a list of orders assigned to him and that have not yet been evaluated.

### 1.4. Found Out Dependencies

- **US32**: Clients must place an order before it can be evaluated.

### 1.5. Input and Output Data

#### **Input Data**
- **Typed Data**:
  - `Evaluation Notes`: Comments or observations about the order during the evaluation process.
  - `Adjusted Proposed Value (Optional)`: Changes to the value proposed by the client, if applicable.

- **Selected Data**:
  - `Order`: Selected from a list of assigned purchase/lease orders that are yet to be evaluated.
  - `Evaluation Decision`: Either "Approved" or "Rejected".

#### **Output Data**
- Updated status of the order reflecting the evaluation decision (e.g., "Approved" or "Rejected").
- Confirmation message of successful evaluation submission.
- Error messages in case of issues, such as "Order no longer available" or "Invalid input data".

### 1.7. Other Relevant Remarks

- **Special Requirements**: The system must ensure that the agent can only evaluate orders assigned to them, and that only orders that have not yet been evaluated are shown.
- **Data and/or Technology Variations**: The `evaluationDecision` should be stored with precise status values such as "Approved" or "Rejected". The `adjustedProposedValue` should handle decimal precision to accommodate property transaction values.
- **Frequency**: This functionality will be frequently used by agents when evaluating property purchase or lease orders.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- The `Listing` class is central to tracking properties available for sale or rent and is directly linked to the evaluation process.
- The `Agent` class represents agents responsible for managing listings and evaluating purchase/lease orders, ensuring that only valid properties are considered.
- Evaluation decisions are tied to the `Order` class, reflecting the agent's analysis of `price`, `business type`, and `publishDate`.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...              | Answer                               | Justification (with patterns)                                                 |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | ... requesting the list of orders for evaluation?        | `EvaluateOrderView`                  | Pure Fabrication: Responsible for UI interactions and initiating the request. |
| Step 2         | ... displaying assigned orders to the agent?             | `EvaluateOrderView`                  | IE: Handles interactions directly with the agent to show orders.              |
| Step 3         | ... capturing the selected order?                        | `EvaluateOrderView`                  | IE: Responsible for gathering the agent's selected order.                     |
| Step 4         | ... requesting evaluation details from the agent?        | `EvaluateOrderView`                  | IE: Responsible for presenting input fields to the agent.                     |
| Step 5         | ... validating the evaluation details?                   | `OrderService`                       | Service: Ensures business rules for order evaluation are followed.            |
| Step 6         | ... updating the order status after evaluation?          | `OrderService`                       | Service: Handles updates to the order's status based on the evaluation.       |
| Step 7         | ... saving the updated status of the order?              | `OrderRepository`                    | High Cohesion: Manages the persistence of updated order statuses.             |
| Step 8         | ... displaying the evaluation confirmation to the agent? | `EvaluateOrderView`                  | IE: Communicates operation success back to the agent.                         |

### Systematization

According to the rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- **Agent**: Represents the actor responsible for evaluating property purchase or lease orders. It interacts with the system to manage assigned orders.
- **EvaluateOrderView**: Provides the user interface for the agent to interact with, including displaying pending orders, capturing selected orders, and showing evaluation results.
- **EvaluateOrderController**: Manages the flow of interactions between the `EvaluateOrderView`, `OrderService`, and `OrderRepository`. It handles retrieving pending orders, processing agent actions, and submitting evaluations.
- **OrderService**: Implements the business logic for managing orders, including retrieving pending orders, validating evaluation data, and updating the order status after an evaluation.
- **OrderRepository**: Abstracts data persistence for orders, supporting operations such as retrieving orders assigned to an agent and saving evaluation details.
- **RepositoryFactory**: Provides a mechanism for accessing repository instances, such as the `OrderRepository`.
- **OrderMemoryRepository**: A concrete implementation of `OrderRepository` for in-memory data handling, suitable for testing or lightweight scenarios.
- **MemoryRepositoryFactory**: Supplies the `OrderMemoryRepository` instance for systems requiring in-memory data persistence.
