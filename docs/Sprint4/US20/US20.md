### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- Property
- Listing
- ListingRepository


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- DisplayListedPropertiesView
- DisplayListedPropertiesController
- DisplayListedPropertiesService
- RepositoryFactory

## 6. Observations
- Store Selection: As per the acceptance criteria, the RegisterAgentController ensures that the Administrator selects a store from a list of available stores. This is facilitated by the StoreContainer, which manages all store instances.
