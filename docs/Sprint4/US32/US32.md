### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...              | Answer                      | Justification (with patterns)                                                                         |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1  		     | 	... interacting with the actor?                         | PlaceOrderView              | Pure Fabrication: Created specifically to handle user interactions related to placing an order.       |
| 			  	         | 	... coordinating the US?                                | PlaceOrderController        | Controller: Manages and coordinates the flow of information and actions required for order placement. |
| 			  		        | 	... retrieving the service?                             | Application                 | Pure Fabrication: Responsible for managing service creation and repository interaction.               |
| Step 2  		     | 	... providing the list of available properties?			      | OrderService                | IE: Knows how to retrieve available properties related to placing an order.                           |
| Step 3  		     | 	... retrieving the repository?                          | RepositoryFactory           | Pure Fabrication: Encapsulates repository creation to ensure flexibility and maintainability.         | 
| 		             | 	... accessing property details for validation?          | OrderRepository             | IE: Manages access to persistent data related to property and order.                                                                                    | 
| Step 4  		     | 	... validating the selected property and order details? | Property                    | IE: Knows its availability and handles validation of its own data.                                                            |
| Step 5  		     | 	... creating and saving the order?	                     | OrderService                | Creator: Responsible for creating the order object and saving it through the repository.                                                                  |
| Step 6  		     | 	... informing the client of operation success?          | PlaceOrderView                            | Pure Fabrication: Displays the operation success to the client, ensuring separation of concerns.                                                          | 


### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

- Client
- Property
- Order

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- PlaceOrderView
- PlaceOrderController
- OrderService
- OrderRepository
- RepositoryFactory

### 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

### 3.2.1. Previous Perspective (using Controllers for a Console UI) 

**On this matter, Sprint 3 add no changes here.**

![US32-SD](US32-SD.svg)

**Notice that:**

- According to the Repository and Service patterns, the CategoryContainer was split in two classes: CategoryRepository and CategoryService, respectively.
- The RepositoryFactory class is the result of applying the Abstract Factory pattern to ensure that the "{XXX}Repository" classes used are all from the same family of objects (i.e., they use the same persistence mechanism).
- No DTO was used, but it could have been.

### 3.2.2. REST API Perspective (reusing the domain logic)

**To accommodate the Sprint 3 requirements.**

![US01-SD-RestAPI](US01-SD-RestAPI.svg)

**This SD is in conformity with the Generic Flow in Any HTTP Request defined [here](../HTTPFlow/HTTPFlow.md).**

**For brevity, sequence diagrams can be simplified to denote just what happens on the respective Controller.**

![US01-SD-RestAPI-Simplified](US01-SD-RestAPI-Simplified.svg)

**Comparing the Sequence Diagrams presented, observe to what extent (100%?) the domain logic was reused without any changes.**

### 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

### 3.3.1. Previous Perspective (using Controllers for a Console UI)

Class diagram as resulting from the above sequence diagram and rationale:

![US32-CD](US32-CD.svg)

Adding to the previous class diagram the classes currently implementing the adopted interfaces.
Notice that the sequence diagram does not state which concrete implementation is being used since it may vary by configurations (cf. "config.ini" file).

Just the new classes are shown.

## 4. Tests

Three relevant test scenarios are highlighted next.
Other test were also specified.

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Category class with invalid values. 

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
          EXPECT_THROW(new Category(L"",L"Category One"),std::invalid_argument);
      }

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithCodeHavingFourChars){
          EXPECT_THROW(new Category(L"C001",L"Category One"),std::invalid_argument);
      }

**Test 2:** Check that it is possible to create an instance of the Category class with valid values.

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithValidData){
          EXPECT_NO_THROW(new Category(L"C0001",L"Category One"));
      }

**Test 3:** Check that it is possible create and add/save a category on the CategoryMemoryRepository.
    
      TEST_F(CategoryMemoryRepositoryFixture, AddingOneCategory){
          EXPECT_TRUE(this->repo->isEmpty());
          shared_ptr<Category> cat = make_shared<Category>(L"C0019", L"Category 19");
          this->repo->save(cat);
          EXPECT_FALSE(this->repo->isEmpty());
      }
    

## 5. Integration and Demo 

A menu option on the console application was added. Such option invokes the CreateCategoryView.

      int CategoriesMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
          int result = 0;
          BaseView * view;
          switch (option) {
          
            case 1:
              view = new CreateCategoryView(this->userToken);
              view->show();
              break;
            ...
          }
          return result;
      }
