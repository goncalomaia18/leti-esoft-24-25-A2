### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

- Client
- Listing
- Order

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- PlaceOrderView
- PlaceOrderController
- OrderService
- OrderRepository
- RepositoryFactory

## 4. Tests

Three relevant test scenarios are highlighted next.
Other test were also specified.

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Category class with invalid values. 

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
          EXPECT_THROW(new Category(L"",L"Category One"),std::invalid_argument);
      }

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithCodeHavingFourChars){
          EXPECT_THROW(new Category(L"C001",L"Category One"),std::invalid_argument);
      }

**Test 2:** Check that it is possible to create an instance of the Category class with valid values.

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithValidData){
          EXPECT_NO_THROW(new Category(L"C0001",L"Category One"));
      }

**Test 3:** Check that it is possible create and add/save a category on the CategoryMemoryRepository.
    
      TEST_F(CategoryMemoryRepositoryFixture, AddingOneCategory){
          EXPECT_TRUE(this->repo->isEmpty());
          shared_ptr<Category> cat = make_shared<Category>(L"C0019", L"Category 19");
          this->repo->save(cat);
          EXPECT_FALSE(this->repo->isEmpty());
      }
    

## 5. Integration and Demo 

A menu option on the console application was added. Such option invokes the CreateCategoryView.

      int CategoriesMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
          int result = 0;
          BaseView * view;
          switch (option) {
          
            case 1:
              view = new CreateCategoryView(this->userToken);
              view->show();
              break;
            ...
          }
          return result;
      }
