---

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- The `VisitRequest` class is responsible for storing and validating the proposed visit dates.
- The `BookingSystem` class will handle the overall processing and interaction with the client.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID                  | Question: Which class is responsible for...                           | Answer              | Justification (with patterns)                                       |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1  		                   | ... interacting with the actor?                                       | BookingView         | Pure Fabrication: Created to handle user interactions.              |
| 		                           | ... coordinating the US?                                              | BookingController   | Controller: Manages interactions and ensures data is processed.     |
| 		                           | ... validating the input data?                                        | VisitRequest        | Information Expert: Knows its data and is responsible for validation.|
| Step 2  		                   | ... confirming or rejecting the request?                              | BookingSystem       | Controller: Handles the logic for confirmations and notifications.  |

### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- **VisitRequest**
- **BookingSystem**

Other software classes (i.e., Pure Fabrication) identified:

- **BookingView**
- **BookingController**

## 4. Tests

### Test 1: Validate Date and Time Format

- **Given**: A client submits a date in an invalid format.
- **When**: The system validates the input.
- **Then**: An error is returned.

---

### Test 2: Allow up to 3 Preferred Dates

- **Given**: A client submits three valid dates.
- **When**: The system processes the request.
- **Then**: The request is accepted.

---

## 5. Integration and Demo

- Menu options for booking requests were added, allowing clients to propose dates.
- The system prompts the client to correct input if validation fails.

---

## 6. Observations

- Ensure the system restricts clients from proposing more than three dates.
- Validation must be comprehensive to prevent invalid formats from being processed.
