# Sprint 3 Entry Point

In this folder the team should collect and keep up-to-date all the artifacts developed during the Sprint related to the Software Development Process activities, namely the Engineering Requirements, OO Analysis and Design activities.

**At the beginning of each Sprint, the team must copy the last version of all artifacts developed in the previous Sprint. For example, when starting Sprint 2, the team must copy all artifacts developed during Sprint 1 to the Sprint 2 folder. When starting Sprint 3, the team must copy all artifacts updated/developed during sprint 2 to the Sprint 3 folder. And so on. This way, each sprint folder will show the project status at the end of that sprint, and the last sprint will have the final version of all artifacts.**

The artifacts should be developed in accordance with the [template files](../(templates)).
