# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (i) are common across several US/UC;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._

- Error messages should be descriptive and offer helpful suggestions for correcting the problem (e.g., invalid input for client registration).
- The system must provide a simple, clear, and consistent user interface across all platforms (web, mobile, console).
- Provide a help section or FAQ for common user issues (e.g., property search filters, how to contact agents).
- Consistent labeling and icons should be used across all screens to ensure uniformity and ease of use.
## Reliability
_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._

## Performance
_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

- The system should start up in less than 10 seconds.
- Under heavy load, the response time must be no more than 5 seconds.

## Supportability
_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._
