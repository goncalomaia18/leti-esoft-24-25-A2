# US 11 - Register a new agent

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As System Administrator, I want to register a new agent.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> By simplicity, an agent must be associated with an existing branch, with all essential details (name, ID number, email, phone, etc.).

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** ?
>
> **Answer:** *

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- AC11-1: The Administrator should choose the store where the agent works (or will work) from a
  list of existing stores.
- AC11-2:  Providing the Citizen Card Number is optional.
### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- No dependencies were found.

- Typed data:
    - AgentÂ´s name
    - Phone number
    - Email
    - Id Number (optional)

- Selected data:
    - Branch where the agent will work

**Output Data:**

- (In)success of the operation

### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- RealEstateAgent
- Branch
- BranchContainer
- AgentContainer
- StoreContainer

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- RegisterAgentView
- RegisterAgentController

## 4. Tests

Three relevant test scenarios are highlighted next.
Other test were also specified.

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Category class with invalid values.

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
          EXPECT_THROW(new Category(L"",L"Category One"),std::invalid_argument);
      }

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithCodeHavingFourChars){
          EXPECT_THROW(new Category(L"C001",L"Category One"),std::invalid_argument);
      }

**Test 2:** Check that it is possible to create an instance of the Category class with valid values.

      TEST_F(CategoryFixture, CreateWithValidData){
          EXPECT_NO_THROW(new Category(L"C0001",L"Category One"));
      }

**Test 3:** Check that it is possible create and add/save a category on the container.

      TEST_F(CategoryContainerFixture, AddingOneCategory){
          EXPECT_TRUE(this->container->isEmpty());
          shared_ptr<Category> cat = this->container->create(L"C0019", L"Category 19");
          this->container->save(cat);
          EXPECT_FALSE(this->container->isEmpty());
      }


## 5. Integration and Demo

A menu option on the console application was added. Such option invokes the CreateCategoryView.

      int AgentMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
          int result = 0;
          BaseView * view;
          switch (option) {
          
            case 1:
              view = new RegisterAgentView(this->userToken);
              view->show();
              break;
            ...
          }
          return result;
      }
