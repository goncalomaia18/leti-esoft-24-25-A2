# US 11 - Register a new agent

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As System Administrator, I want to register a new agent.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> By simplicity, an agent must be associated with an existing branch, with all essential details (name, ID number, email, phone, etc.).

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** ?
>
> **Answer:** *

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- AC11-1: The Administrator should choose the store where the agent works (or will work) from a
  list of existing stores.
- AC11-2:  Providing the Citizen Card Number is optional.
### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- RealEstateAgent
- Branch
- BranchContainer
- AgentContainer
- StoreContainer

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- RegisterAgentView
- RegisterAgentController

## 4. Tests

Three relevant test scenarios are highlighted next.
Other test were also specified.

**Test 1:** Validating that an agent cannot be created with invalid data

      TEST_F(AgentFixture, CreateWithEmptyName) {
    EXPECT_THROW(new RealEstateAgent(L"", L"12345678"), std::invalid_argument);
    }

     TEST_F(AgentFixture, CreateWithInvalidCitizenCard) {
    EXPECT_THROW(new RealEstateAgent(L"Pedro Sousa", L"INVALID_CARD"), std::invalid_argument);
    }


**Test 2:** Verifying that an agent can be created with valid data

      TEST_F(AgentFixture, CreateWithValidData) {
    EXPECT_NO_THROW(new RealEstateAgent(L"Pedro Sousa", L"12345678"));
    }


**Test 3:** Assigning an agent to a store and saving the agent

      TEST_F(AgentContainerFixture, AddingAgentToStore) {
    EXPECT_TRUE(this->container->isEmpty());
    shared_ptr<RealEstateAgent> agent = this->container->create(L"John Doe", L"12345678");
    shared_ptr<Store> store = this->storeContainer->findStore(L"ST001");
    store->addAgent(agent);
    this->container->save(agent);
    EXPECT_FALSE(this->container->isEmpty());
    EXPECT_TRUE(store->hasAgent(agent));
    }




## 5. Integration and Demo

Two menu options on the console application were added. Such options invoke the RegisterAgentView and StoreSelectionView.

    int AgentMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
    int result = 0;
    BaseView *view;
    switch (option) {
        case 2: // Register a New Agent
            view = new RegisterAgentView(this->userToken);
            view->show();
            break;
        case 3: // Select Store for Agent
            view = new StoreSelectionView(this->userToken);
            view->show();
            break;
    }
    return result;
    }



## 6. Observations
- Store Selection: As per the acceptance criteria, the RegisterAgentController ensures that the Administrator selects a store from a list of available stores. This is facilitated by the StoreContainer, which manages all store instances.
