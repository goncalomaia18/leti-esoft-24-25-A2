This repository contains some artifacts relevant to the project to be developed during the 3rd semester of the [Software Engineering (ESOFT)](https://portal.isep.ipp.pt/intranet/education/visualiza_ficha_uc_v10.aspx?cde=67315) course unit of the [Bachelor in Telecommunications and Informatics Engineering (LETI)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/473) from the [School of Engineering â€“ Polytechnic of Porto (ISEP)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt).

In particular, it has:

- The [Team Members and Tasks Distribution](docs/TeamMembersAndTasks.md) during sprints;
- [Templates](docs/(templates)) to capture and systematize evidence of proper application of the Software Development Process, namely regarding the activities of Engineering Requirements, OO Analysis and Design.

The Dream House Management System (DHMS) project is just an umbrella to the other subprojects (Core, CoreTests and ConsoleApp) and has the same structure used in the [DemoTasks project](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/pluginfile.php/386013/mod_label/intro/DemoTasks_V0.zip), from lab classes. As such:

- Core should be a **library** where the domain logic and entities reside;
- CoreTests should have a set of regression tests over the Core classes;
- ConsoleApp should be an executable console application providing a basic User Interface (UI) allowing users to perform some application domain functionalities.
